ZeeMouse

Written by Larry Bank
Linux version started 3/7/2016

The name is a reference to the original version from several years ago
which I wrote to communicate with the ZeeMote bluetooth game controller.
The device used a proprietary protocol on top of RFCOMM
instead of implementing HID as a "normal" joystick would. I soon added
support for several other "undocumented" bluetooth game controllers which
did the same thing. A while later, Power-A released their MOGA controller.
They tried to be sneaky by creating a protocol which required special bytes
to be transmitted to the device before it would send any information. The
normal protocols for bluetooth game controllers is to constantly send info
when a button or stick position changes. Power-A tried to tightly control
what software was authorized to talk to their game controllers. It obviously
didn't work as well as they had planned because their follow-on products
added support for the standard HID protocol. ZeeMouse supports the following
devices: ZeeMote, BGP100, iControlPad, SteelSeries:Free, Moga, Moga2, Moga Pro,
Moga Pro 2

Building:
---------
The GTK3 and Bluetooth libraries need to be installed to build ZeeMouse.
If you don't have them installed, use the following commands:
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev

When everything is installed, simply run 'make' in the git repo directory.
The executable produced is simply called 'zm'. You can run it from the command
line or create a desktop icon for it.

*** NOTE *** before running ZeeMouse for the first time, you must run
'make install' to set up the GTK settings information in your system.

Possible preparation needed for RFCOMM to work properly:
sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service
add -C at the end of ExecStart= to start the bluetooth daemon in compatibility
mode. Add a new 'ExecStartPost=' immediately after that line, to add the SP
profile. The two lines should look like this:
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -C
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/sdptool add SP

save and reboot.

Running:
--------
When you run ZeeMouse, a GTK window will appear with 3 buttons. Power up a
supported bluetooth device and press the 'Scan' button. Any recognized devices
will be added to the device list. The device list is saved to the system
settings, so it isn't necessary to re-scan your devices each time you run
ZeeMouse. The device name, address and mode are displayed in the list. To
change the mode of a device, select it in the list and press the 'Mode' button
on the toolbar. This will cycle through the three available modes.

When your device is set up the way you want, select its name in the list and
press the 'Connect' button. Once connected, the button will change into a
'Disconnect' button. While connected, the bluetooth device will move the
mouse pointer and/or generate keycodes for button presses and joystick
position changes.
